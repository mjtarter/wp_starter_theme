My customized version of the underscores starter theme (https://underscores.me/)

How is this theme different from the out of the box underscores theme?
- Bootstrap Integration
- Adobe Font Implementation (Change script in functions.php if your own custom Adobe fonts are desired)
- jQuery Integration
- Image Folder added to theme (includes hamburger and X icons for the navigation)
- Sidebar Removed
- Unnecessary content removed from pages (Title, Dumby content, Footer content, etc.) 
- Basic Footer Added
- Header Improved (Includes sticky nav and basic desktop and mobile menus)
- Some very basic CSS added (Header, Footer, Global)
